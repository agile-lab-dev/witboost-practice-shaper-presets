Designed by [Agile Lab](https://www.agilelab.it/), Witboost is a versatile platform that addresses a wide range of sophisticated data engineering challenges. It enables businesses to discover, enhance, and productize their data, fostering the creation of automated data platforms that adhere to the highest standards of data governance. Want to know more about witboost? Check it out [here](https://witboost.com/platform) or [contact us!](https://witboost.com/contact-us)

This repository is part of our [Starter Kit](https://github.com/agile-lab-dev/witboost-starter-kit) meant to showcase witboost's integration capabilities and provide a "batteries-included" product.

## Overview

The **Practice Shaper** is the main and most impactful witboost setting that models witboost entities (domains, systems, components, templates) as nodes of a fully-configurable **property graph**.

This enables data-oriented organizations to shape witboost based on their unique use cases, structure, and needs.

Thanks to the Practice Shaper, a company can approach any project scenario in data (**Data Landscape**), such as Data Mesh, Business Intelligence, Machine Learning and others, by defining which practices are enabled and regulated, with the possibility to define technological and methodological guardrails.

Refer to the [witboost documentation](https://docs.witboost.agilelab.it) to learn more about Practice Shaper and Data Landscapes.

## Property Graph

The Practice Shaper property graph is composed of:

- **type nodes** - vertices representing abstract concepts (classes)
- **instance nodes** - concrete entities each instantiating one of the available type nodes
- **relations** - they are used to define relationships between nodes. For example, an instance node will always express an `instanceOf` relation towards a type node

Type nodes and the relations among them are defined by the Platform Team when configuring a Data Landscape.

Instance nodes and their relationships with type nodes (and other instance nodes) are generated by end users as they interact with the platform, within the context of a data landscape.

Both type and instance nodes are registered as witboost entities: their definition is provided by a catalog info YAML file (hosted in a Git repository), and they are part of the **witboost catalog**.
